## Introduction

Manticore is a clean-slate research operating system, written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with the aim of exploring the [parakernel](http://penberg.org/parakernel-hotos19.pdf) OS architecture.

Please refer to the [project homepage](https://manticoreos.io/) for more information.

## Getting Started

### Building from Sources

First, install the toolchain, which includes [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/), Rust, and other dependencies:

```
./scripts/install-toolchain
```

Now that you have the toolchain installed, you can build Manticore with:

```
make
```

The build system generates a `kernel.iso` image, which you can launch under QEMU with:

```
$ ./scripts/run kernel.iso
```

For more information, see [Manticore Hacker's Guide](HACKING.md).

### Running Example Applications

Once `kernel.elf` is built, you can build an user space echo server with:

```
$ make -C usr/echod
```

and launch it under QEMU with:

```
$ ./scripts/run --publish 7777/udp usr/echod/echod.iso
```

You can now communicate with the echo server with:

```
$ nc -u4 localhost 7777
hello
hello
```

### Supported Hardware

 * Legacy-free PC with a 64-bit x86 processor
   * xAPIC2 interrupt controller
   * MSI-X interrupt delivery
   * PCIe 3.0 bus
 * VirtIO network device

### Code Structure

Manticore's code is structured into different directories as follows:

* [`arch`](./arch): machine architecture specific code
* [`drivers`](./drivers): device drivers
  * [`virtio`](./drivers/virtio): VirtIO device drivers
  * [`pci`](./drivers/pci): PCIe device drivers
* [`kernel`](./kernel): kernel services (e.g., process scheduling and system calls)
* [`lib`](./lib): support libraries
* [`mm`](./mm): memory management (e.g., virtual memory manager and kernel dynamic memory allocator)
* [`usr`](./usr): user space libraries and example applications
